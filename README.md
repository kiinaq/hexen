# Hexen Programming Language

A laboratory for learning and designing a new system programming language.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of Hexen is not to create the next mainstream programming language, but to:

- **Learn** by doing: Understand language design principles through hands-on experience
- **Design** a system programming language by combining the best ideas from our brainstorming
- **Build** a complete compiler toolchain from scratch
- **Document** the entire process to share knowledge and insights

## Philosophy

Hexen is an educational journey into language design and compiler construction. Every decision, experiment, and iteration will be documented to create a comprehensive learning resource.
