# Hexen Programming Language

A laboratory for learning and designing a new system programming language.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of Hexen is not to create the next mainstream programming language, but to:

- **Learn** by doing: Understand language design principles through hands-on experience
- **Design** a system programming language by combining the best ideas
- **Build** a complete compiler toolchain from scratch
- **Document** the entire process to share knowledge and insights

## Philosophy

Hexen is an educational journey into language design and compiler construction. Every decision, experiment, and iteration will be documented to create a comprehensive learning resource.

## Design Principles

Hexen follows four core design principles that guide every language feature and implementation decision:

### ðŸŽ¯ Ergonomic
*"Pedantic to write, but really easy to read"*

The language syntax should prioritize clarity and readability over brevity. While it may require more explicit code when writing, the result should be immediately understandable to anyone reading it. Code is read far more often than it's written, so we optimize for the reader's experience.

### ðŸ§¹ Clean
*"There is only one way to do a thing"*

For any given task, Hexen provides exactly one idiomatic way to accomplish it. This eliminates choice paralysis, reduces cognitive load, and ensures consistency across codebases. When there's only one way, there's no wrong way.

### ðŸ§  Logic
*"No tricks to remember, only natural approaches"*

Language features should build upon each other naturally and logically. Complex concepts should emerge from the combination of simpler, more general principles rather than being special cases or syntactic sugar. Understanding one concept should help you understand related concepts.

### âš¡ Pragmatic
*"Focus on what works better, not on covering everything"*

Hexen chooses only the features that matter most for achieving results. Rather than trying to be everything to everyone, we deliberately select a focused set of capabilities that work exceptionally well together. Every feature must justify its existence by solving real problems effectively.
